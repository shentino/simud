/** Defines climates.
 *
 * All climates must have a "clear" weather pattern; this is the base weather
 * for new areas, so you do need it.
 *
 * A climate consists of a group of weather 'nodes', connected by transitions.
 * This should be really easy for anyone with a rudimentary understanding of
 * graph theory. Transitions are unidirectional, which allows you to have
 * lengthy scripted weather patterns if you wish.
 *
 * To create your own weather patterns, take a peek at the create() function.

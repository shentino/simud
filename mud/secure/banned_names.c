 * The banned names are stored as a string of regular expressions. For
 * swearwords and similar, you should call add_banned_expression, and
 * it will generate a very general regular expression that will not
 * only ban the swearword, but will also understand unusal casing,
 * (sPaM), intermediate characters (s_p_a_m), and inserting it into
 * the middle of words (_sp_am_me_is_ter). Otherwise call add_banned_name,
 * which only bans the literal spelling which you give.

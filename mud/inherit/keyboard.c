 * This component should be included in any object that needs to
 * have its own keyboard settings. Players are the primary example
 * of this. The MUD has a pretty decent set of "default" escape
 * codes built in (see keys.h), but players using unusual
 * telnet clients may need to override some of them -- this is
 * particularly common for fixing the backspace/delete fiasco.
 * This file holds their override settings. These settings are
 * manipulated by the 'keysetup' verb.

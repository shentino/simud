/** A small component to handle objects that have paintable points ("spots").
 * This would include things like walls, bodies of water in custom areas, etc.
 *
 * Spots are not quite the same thing as shapes. For one thing, shapes
 * are volatile (lots of code resets your shape, i.e. to update it), whereas
 * spots remain consistent. The spots mapping is guaranteed to remain a mapping,
 * whereas if shape is a non-mapping (usually a 0) you should regenerate it.
 * Generally the shape is generated from the spots. However, the shape
 * might contain more point than the spots mapping -- this can happen with
 * objects whose 'spots' are very large, such as a wide city wall. Each
 * unit of wall might be one spot, but 5x3 units in the shape.

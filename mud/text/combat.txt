How does combat work?

Combat begins when one party or the other uses the 'kill verb'. There may be
other ways to start combat, such as adding a target directly, but using the
kill verb is the most kosher. The kill verb is defined in /bin/kill.c

The kill verb does the following:
  * Checks to make sure that the target is valid (i.e. not yourself, and
present in the room)
  * Checks that your readiness is >= 1000.
  * If the above are valid, it calls start_combat in this_player(), passing
it a pointer to the object to be killed and the integer '1'. It also prints
the message "~Name ~verbattack ~targ!"

---

start_combat() takes two parameters: A pointer to the enemy ('enemy'), and
an 'initiative' value. The initiative parameter is unused.

start_combat() clamps readiness into the range RMIN_READINESS through
RMAX_READINESS[1]. It then adds 'enemy' to the front of the target stack[2].
Note that it does not currently notify the target that it has been attacked.
Finally, it turns on heart_beat for living.c.

---

heart_beat() is one of the most complex functions in combat. It is called
every 2 seconds (on a lag-free server; it can be slower if server lag is
high). The heart_beat function generally affects the creature in whom it is
beating. It does the following, in this order:

* If the creature is dead, it sets the 'is_corpse' flag to true, and the
'doing' message to 0 (default). This is done in the heart beat, rather than
at the moment they die, so that you don't get 'the corpse of ...' messages
prematurely in combat messages.

* If the 'doing' flag is not 0, Then it decrements a doing_delay counter.
When the counter reaches zero, the 'doing' message is set to 0. This is so
that actions expire.

* If (hp < maxhp) and the creature is not dead, it increments 'heal_count'.
Once (heal_count >= heal_delay), the creatuer gains a single hit point. This
is how regeneration works.

* The same regeneration is done for mana using mana_heal_count, mana, and
maxmana.

* The same regeneration is done for endurance using end_heal_count,
endurance, and maxend.

* drop_invalid_targets() is called (see below for description).

* If the creature is not held ('held' variable is false) and not busy
('busy' variable is false), and if the creature's current readiness score is
below MAX_READINESS, then their readiness is increased[3]. The function
show_ready() is called (see below).

- If the readiness requirement of the first item on the creature's action
queue is above MAX_READINESS, then the character's readiness will continue
to be incremented, even though it exceeds the normal maximum.

* If the creature is held (held > 0), then the 'held' time is decremented.

* If the creature is busy (busy > 0), and NOT currently held (held == 0),
then the 'busy' time is decremented.

---

drop_invalid_targets() scans through the list of the creature's targets, and
removes any from the list that are no longer valid combat targets. It is
determined as follows:

* If any of the targets are 'false' (i.e., they have been destructed), they
are dropped.
* Any target that returns true on 'query_dead' is dropped.
* If the target array is ({ }) by the end of the function call, then it is
set to 0.
* If the current target has left the room, it is moved to the end of the
target list. This is not done in a loop. If every target in the array has
left the room, the list will simply spin around, one rotation per call to
this function.

---

show_ready()

If this_object()->query_autoready() returns true, then this function writes
out a 'readiness meter', which is a colorful display of the creature's
current readiness (on a scale from 0-1000) and the next action on its combat
queue. If query_autoready() is false, this function does nothing.

---

get_battle_action()

Returns the battle action on the front of the combat queue *without* popping
it off. If there is none, it returns query_default_action(). See the doxygen
for this function for the format of the queue (it's rather complex).

Footnotes: Minor technical gotchas that seemed too confusing or detailed to
be useful to most people.

(1) RMIN_READINESS is defined as -MAX_READINESS, and RMAX_READINESS is
defined as 2*MAX_READINESS. MAX_READINESS is currently equal to 1000. These
constants are in const/battconst.h (that is, /include/const/battconst.h --
since the include directory could be moved, it is conventional to leave it
off).

(2) A list of current targets, stored as an array. It is allowed for it to
be 0 if it is empty, so anything that modifies it should first check that it
holds an array.

(3) Using the formula ((speed+speed_bonus)*3)d4 + ((will+will_bonus)*3)d6
... the 'd#' is the D&D dice roll notation. Accurate dice probabilities are
used.

--------PART TWO-------

The forms directory:

FORMS_DIR "/battle/forms/"

The basic form is "form.c". It is found in /battle/forms/form.c, and has an
associated include file (#include <form.h>). All forms should include it to
provide them with a basic form implementation for the wizard to modify. This
also ensures that if we later add extra features to form, their legacy forms
will automatically have those features included as well.

Forms should be non-clonable objects.

#pragma no_clone

will appear in the form.h file.

The basic attributes of a form are as follows:

* Returns the message to be given to the listener to indicate that someone's
form has changed. The person changing form is this_player(). The reason for
the listener is so that this function may decide whether to give a different
message to someone who recognizes the form.
string query_change_message( object listener )

* Allowed actions within the form
mixed *query_allowed_actions()
-- An array of action structures (see below)

* Allowed reactions within the form
string *query_allowed_reactions()
-- An array of file names for objects

* Maximum allowed allocation for attitude points
int *query_attitudes()
-- An array of four integers

* The minimum scores for each attitude category. These act as 'bonus'
attitude points, since none have to be allocated. This is good for forms
that, i.e., always have a very high dodging bonus.
int *query_attitudes_bonus()
-- An array of four integers

* Names of the attitude point allocations
string *query_attitude_names()
-- An array of four constant strings

* Name of the form
string query_name()

Combat actions should be implemented as bin/ verbs. Combat reactions will go
in

REACTIONS_DIR "/battle/reactions/"

Combat actions should #include <battle.h>. This gives the coder access to
lots of useful constants and calculation functions that should make coding a
typical action easier. It may also provide some default functions that can
be queried by objects that use actions.

The combat action consists of two parts: the main() function, which is
primarily concerned with parsing the typed command (if there was one), and
the do_action() function, which actually performs the action.

The main() function must, minimally, makes a call to
this_player()->push_action(). The value passed into push_action() is a
specially assembled array that contains information necessary for performing
the action.

({
   The readiness/poise requirement (not including stance & form change) -- 1000 is typical,
   The file name of the bin verb (could be an object pointer),
   The name of the do_action() function (omit the "do_", it is implied),
   The action's target -- an object pointer, or -1 for "current target",
   Bitwise OR'd flags for the required action stance. See the ST_XXXX constants in const/battconst.h,
   Parameter -- a single value that will be passed to the do_action function.
})

Note that you should use the "parameter" to store any and all information
regarding the action. Do NOT use global variables inside of your verb, since
multiple people may have active action records for that verb at the same
time! There is almost never a reason to have a global variable declaration
in combat verbs.

Note that forms will usually build these structures directly, without
calling the main() function to push it on the player's action queue. Thus,
you shouldn't count on every action performed by the verb passing through
the main() function first.

The do_action is responsible for all of its own messaging. Several standard
functions ought to be written to make it easier to use stance-, form-, and
counterattack- based messaging, but these should not be imposed as a
requirement. Additionally, it is not strictly required that an action force
a reaction -- it must be specified in the do_action() code.

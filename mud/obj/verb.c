/** This file will handle some simple verb conjugation in English. It
 * is used by the simul_efun function process_string to do verb
 * conjugation, so you probably will not need to do anything here
 * directly. The reason it is in a separate file is so that you can
 * expand the verb capabilities without major difficulty. The verb
 * codes you should use are:
 *
 * ~Verb (present simple, upper case)
 * ~verb (present simple, lower case)
 * ~Vert (present simple, upper case, for target)
 * ~vert (present simple, lower case, for target)
 *
 * Example: ~Name ~verbpick up the rock.
 *
 * This phrase can be processed to both "You pick up the rock."
 * and "Bob picks up the rock." There are some other useful codes
 * you can use in these phrases. They are:
 *
 * - ~Targ -- The name of the target. If the target is the listener,
 * - then ~Targ will process to 'You' instead.
 * - ~Pron -- A pronoun for the subject of the sentence. Converts to 'you' if
 *   the subject is the listener, and he/she/it if not.
 * - ~Prot -- Same as ~Pron but for the target, not the subject.
 * - ~Poss -- Possessive for the subject, or 'your'.
 * - ~Post -- Same as ~Poss but for the target.
 *
 * All these have a lower case form.
 *
 * This will only handle a few irregulars. If you find an irregular verb
 * which is not handled properly, go ahead and add it in here.

/** Scenery is an alternate use of the description/item combination
 * (as it appears in trinkets). Unlike a trinket, scenery should provide
 * a "phrase" in the short description. This phrase, which is always a
 * complete sentence, is tacked on immediately to the end of the long
 * description and will not show up on the "You see" list. It should have
 * no extra spaces on the beginning or end, and it is polite to drop the
 * color back to light gray at the end of the phrase if you use color
 * changes.
 *
 * The main purpose of scenery is to allow for player level flexibility
 * in the fine art of interior design. Scenery could be inherited and
 * modified to make it destroyable. I also intend to make scenery in
 * which you can hide objects, secrete yourself, etc.

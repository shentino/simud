/** This file defines the area object, which is used for organizing
 * the world into meaningful regions. Area objects may contain either
 * other area objects, or rooms. The outermost area objects are themselves
 * contained by the world object, making the MUD a complete hierarchy.
 *
 * Areas behave as "tiled maps" which means that they allow you to
 * define a grid on which your rooms are arranged; this is useful
 * for many things, primarily building the room maps or shapes.
 *
 * Areas have gone through quite a few design iterations, during
 * which time we constantly change our mind as to what we're using
 * them for. In general, they are a method for hierarchically organizing
 * rooms.

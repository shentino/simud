WIZARD CONCEPTS
AREAS
Areas are special objects used for organizing rooms and other areas into a
hierarchy. They may have descriptions, and may
have exits (at least for now). They are still in flux, so it is difficult
to give accurate help on them right now :-). Check the doxygen for the
latest information.

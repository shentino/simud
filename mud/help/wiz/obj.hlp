WIZARD HELP
DIRECTORIES: /obj
The /obj directory mostly contains source code for the most basic objects in
the MUD. You may ~CCOMclone~CHLP these source files to make objects.
Examples of the kind of files you will find: generic food, items, monsters,
etc. The documentation on the web will describe what the individual files
are for.
